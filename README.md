# How do I use this?
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

### Download via command line
If you know how to use the terminal or command prompt, you can navigate to the directory you want to download this project to and run the command:

`git clone https://github.com/Yeti-Robotics/TemplateYetiRobot.git`

If you don't know how to do that, chatGPT is a great resource.

### Download via IntelliJ
If you have a project open, go to `File>New>Project from version control`
then input this url: `https://github.com/Yeti-Robotics/TemplateYetiRobot.git`.

If you do not have a project open, click the `Get from VCS` button.


Once you have the project downloaded, you can open it in IntelliJ and start coding.
Make sure you have set up your development environment by following [this guide](https://docs.yetirobotics.org/books/robot-software/page/getting-started-with-robot-development)
